Doc is the NetApp AI assistant available on docs.netapp.com. It answers questions using only the content from this site. Doc does not use content from other NetApp sites or the public internet to answer questions.

Doc can build responses from previous questions, suggest additional questions, and explain how it generates responses. This makes it a valuable tool for navigating NetApp documentation.

== Scope and limitations
Doc can only answer questions based on content published on docs.netapp.com.

NOTE: During this beta phase, Doc is trained only on ONTAP, BlueXP, StorageGRID, Keystone, and SnapCenter content. If you need information Doc doesn't have, let us know.

* If you don't specify a product version, Doc answers questions based on the latest published version. If needed, you can specify an earlier version in your question. 
* Doc does not know what page you are on when you ask a question. For best results, be specific with product names and versions. 
* Doc can chat in languages supported on docs.netapp.com, but isn't trained on non-English versions. 

== Writing good prompts
Follow these tips for the best experience with Doc.

Ask specific questions.:: Write detailed questions and specify the product name, version, and interface type (GUI, API). For example:
+
====
What steps should I follow in System Manager to upgrade from ONTAP 9.8 to ONTAP 9.12.1?
====

Ask for steps to complete a task.:: Ask Doc to include the steps to complete a process. Instead of asking _How do I install the BlueXP Connector without internet?_ try:
+
====
What steps should I follow to install the BlueXP Connector without internet?
====

Break complex questions into chunks.:: Break complex questions into smaller questions (also known as _chaining_). Doc remembers previous questions and builds more complex answers as you continue to chat. 
+
For example, instead of asking Doc _How do I configure ransomware protection and backup schedules in BlueXP?_ try:
+
====
What are the steps to configure ransomware protection in BlueXP?
====
+
then ask:
+
====
What are the steps to configure backup schedules in BlueXP?
====

Use quotation marks.:: Enclose multi-word phrases in quotation marks. This helps Doc recognize the phrase as a single concept, similar to how you might emphasize it in a conversation with a human.
+
For example, in this question, _How is storage efficiency calculated in ONTAP?_ Doc might think you're asking about _storage_ and _efficiency_ as two unrelated words. Instead try:
+
====
How is "storage efficiency" calculated in ONTAP?
====

Review how Doc responded.:: After responding, Doc provides insights into how it generated its response. This can give you ideas for how to refine your question to get the results you want. 

Clear your chat history:: If you want to change topics, clear the chat at start fresh. Because Doc remembers previous questions, topic changes can produce unexpected results.
